# Shapefiles

Store some shapefiles we use in a centralized repo.

Note that currently only ESRI Shapefile is supported. So we add other types like
`.map` to the .gitignore. So that you can copy / paste the source data folder to
overwrite local folder, then commit without worrying committing too much files.
